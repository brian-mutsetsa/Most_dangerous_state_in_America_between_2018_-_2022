As part of my Geoinformatics Assignment, I was to pick an interest and create a choropleth map, referencing my interest. This is what I would do:
- Pick an interest i.e "The most dangerous States in The USA!"
- Select the location of the USA
- Collect and clean data that shows the crime rate between each state, taken from a trusted USA source (i.e usa.gov)
- Use that data to find out the crime rates between 2018 & 2022
- Rank the states in terms of danger level.
- Plot a choropleth map of the USA showing the most dangerous of States by colour:
-   The darker the red: The more dangerous it is.
-   The darker the blue: The less dangerous it is.

Main tools of this assignment:
- Google Maps API
- Python Notebook
- Pandas, Csv and Follium libraries
